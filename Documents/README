Assignment 8 - Card_Sampling
Authors: Trevor Yokoyama and Jacob Hamsher
March 24, 2017

Description:
The purpose of this project was to find the different probabilities of a poker hand. This was accomplished through the use of an exhaustive and stochastic method. Enums 
were also used for the values and suits of each of the individual cards.

TA NOTICE:
We decided to forgo the Texas Hold em part of the assignment because of time reasons. Also the random number generator that was made in the lab did not work for us 
causing us to develop our own generator that is based on the current system time. 

Problems:
We had some problems regarding the enums as we did not know the correct syntax for some of them. We also ran into trouble when finding the exhaustive and stochastic percents,
but this was due to a syntax error and a conditional fixed it for us.

I pledge that the work done here was my own and that I have learned how to write
	      this program (such that I could throw it out and restart and finish it in a timely
	      manner).  I am not turning in any work that I cannot understand, describe, or
	      recreate.  Any sources (e.g., web sites) other than the lecture that I used to
	      help write the code are cited in my work.  When working with a partner, I have
	      contributed an equal share and understand all the submitted work.  Further, I have
	      helped write all the code assigned as pair-programming and reviewed all code that
	      was written separately.
